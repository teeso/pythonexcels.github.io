# Mapping Excel VB Macros to Python

A handy feature in Excel is the ability to quickly record a Visual Basic (VB)
macro and save it. It’s also fairly simple to take a captured VB macro, tweak it
slightly and use it in your Python scripts. I’ve used this capability dozens of
times over the years to capture a sequence of operations that modify a
spreadsheet and build a pivot table or chart, then integrate the macro into a
Python script. It wasn’t always apparent to me how I could take the macro and
use it within Python or other scripting languages beside Visual Basic, but I now
have a pretty good grasp and want to share the technique with you.

This post illustrates how to capture a simple set of operations in a macro,
examine the Visual Basic macro, port it to Python and run it. I’m using the
MultiplicationTable.xlsx file as a starting point, it’s a simple 10×10
multiplication table that will be expanded and reformatted. The first step is to
capture the macro in Excel using Record Macro. In Excel 2007 the Developer tab
that contains the Record Macro button is turned off by default, you will need to
enable it by selecting “Excel Options” from the ribbon menu, then select
“Popular” in the left hand column and select the “Show Developer tab in the
Ribbon” checkbox as shown here.

![exceloptions](images/20091012_exceloptions.png)

Starting with a simple spreadsheet containing a table of data, click on the
“Developer” tab, then “Record Macro”.

![recordmacro](images/20091012_recordmacro.png)

If you’re using an older version of Excel, select Tools->Macro->Record New Macro
from the menu as shown here.

![recordmacroexcel2003](images/20091012_recordmacroexcel2003.png)

The goal is to expand the existing table to a 15×15 table, adjust the column
width to make the table appear more square and save the new spreadsheet. Now
that the macro is recording, the first step is to select the last row of data
and expanding it by dragging it down an additional 5 rows. First, select the
data:

![selectrow](images/20091012_selectrow.png)

then dragged to create 5 new rows of data.

![dragrow](images/20091012_dragrow.png)

Do the same select and drag operation for the last column of data to create 5
new columns.

![selectcolumn](images/20091012_selectcolumn.png)

![dragcolumn](images/20091012_dragcolumn.png)

Now you have a 15×15 multiplication table. To resize the columns, select the
headers for columns B through P, click the right mouse and select “Column
Width”.

![columnwidth](images/20091012_columnwidth.png)

Enter “4” as the new column width and click OK. The spreadsheet will now look like this:

![resizecolumns](images/20091012_resizecolumns.png)

Now stop capturing the macro by clicking on Stop Recording

![stoprecording](images/20091012_stoprecording.png)

If you’re using an older version of Excel, select Tools->Macro->Stop Recording
from the menu bar.

To view the macro, click on the View Macros button

![viewmacros](images/20091012_viewmacros.png)

For older versions of Excel, select Tools->Macro->Macros

Select the macro you just recorded (this should be Macro1, but if you were
experimenting you may have other macros, so select the highest numbered macro)
and click Edit.

![editmacro](images/20091012_editmacro.png)

This opens your macro in the Microsoft Visual Basic GUI, and it should look
something like this

```
Sub Macro1()
'
' Macro1 Macro
'

'
    Range("B11:K11").Select
    Selection.AutoFill Destination:=Range("B11:K16"), Type:=xlFillDefault
    Range("B11:K16").Select
    Range("K2:K16").Select
    Selection.AutoFill Destination:=Range("K2:P16"), Type:=xlFillDefault
    Range("K2:P16").Select
    Columns("B:P").Select
    Selection.ColumnWidth = 4
End Sub
```

Don’t worry if there are some extra or redundant lines in your macro, they can
be removed as the script is ported. Now we’re ready to fire up Python and
integrate this macro into a script.

## Porting

To get started, start the Python Integrated Development Environment (IDLE), then
open the spreadsheet with the 10×10 multiplication table by entering the
following four commands (make sure the file “MultiplicationTable.xlsx” is in
your My Documents folder.

![introidle](images/20091012_introidle.png)

Your screen should now look like this:

![introfullscreen](images/20091012_introfullscreen.png)

These are boilerplate commands you’ll be using in each exercise to invoke and
interface to Excel. The first two commands, ``import win32com.client as win32``, and
``excel =win32.gencache.EnsureDispatch('Excel.Application')``, import the win32
module and open the Excel process. The command ``wb =
excel.Workbooks.Open('MultiplicationTable.xlsx')`` opens the worksheet. In
general, you’ll need a ``excel.Workbooks.Open()`` or ``excel.Workbooks.Add()`` command
to open an existing workbook or create a new workbook. The command ``excel.Visible
= True`` makes Excel visible on the screen, rather than running as a process
with no visible window.

Looking at the Macro1 macro, the first command is ``Range("B11:K11").Select``. The
Range variable name is within the context of the Worksheet, so you need to create
a container for operations on the worksheet. The command ``ws =
wb.Worksheets('Sheet1')`` will do the trick.

![wsworksheet](images/20091012_wsworksheet.png)

If you noticed, I made a typo when entering the command and typed Worksheet
instead of Worksheets. Don’t panic if you make a mistake as I did, in most cases
you can simply retype the correct command and continue on.

Once the variable pointing to the worksheet is defined, append the macro command
to ``ws.`` and try it. Note that Select is a function and requires the open and
close parenthesis pair in order to operate correctly. This pattern may be used
for every ``Range().Select`` line in the macro.

![wsb11k11select](images/20091012_wsb11k11select.png)

If you bring the worksheet to the foreground, you’ll see that the range B11:K11
has been selected. The next task is to autofill the 5 rows below using the
``Selection.AutoFillDestination:=Range("B11:K16"), Type:=xlFillDefault`` construct.
Selection is a method at the Excel Application level, you need to precede it
with ``excel.`` in this example. The arguments ``Destination:=Range("B11:K16"),
Type:=xlFillDefault`` must be provided to the function, either using the keyword
arguments Destination and Type, or by using positional notation. To make your
programs as robust as possible, you should include the keywords, but it’s not
strictly required and I don’t use that pattern in this example.

The definition for the constant ``xlFillDefault`` is contained in ``win32.constants``,
you can access this value by specifying ``win32.constants.xlFillDefault``. I’ve seen
many examples where the developer replaces this with the actual value (0 in this
case). My preference is to avoid replacing Excel variables with numbers in my
scripts, I believe that including the variable names increases the clarity of
the script. My preference is to use the fully specified name wherever possible,
but if you have to replace the variable with the actual value, you can always
use the Object Browser in the VB window to figure out the correct value (open
the Object Browser by pressing F2, or by selecting View->Object Browser from the
menu in the VB window.

![vbobjectbrowser](images/20091012_vbobjectbrowser.png)

Combining these translations, the full Python command is
``excel.Selection.AutoFill(Destination=ws.Range("B11:K16"),
Type=win32.constants.xlFillDefault)``, or ``excel.Selection.AutoFill(
ws.Range("B11:K16"), win32.constants.xlFillDefault)`` as I’ve used in the example.

![idlefillrow](images/20091012_idlefillrow.png)

Occasionally you’ll make a mistake when capturing a macro and record extra,
unnecessary commands. The command ``Range("B11:K16").Select`` isn’t needed and can
be ignored. The next two macro commands, ``Range("K2:K16").Select`` and
``Selection.AutoFillDestination:=Range("K2:P16"), Type:=xlFillDefault``, are
translated in the same way as the Select and AutoFill commands discussed
earlier.

The commands ``Range("K2:K16").Select`` and ``Selection.AutoFill
Destination:=Range("K2:P16"), Type:=xlFillDefault`` are translated the same
way as the earlier Select and AutoFillcommands as shown below.

![idlefillcolumn](images/20091012_idlefillcolumn.png)

The worksheet is now expanded to the full 15×15 table and looks like this:

![worksheetfilled](images/20091012_worksheetfilled.png)

The next section of the macro selects columns B through P and sets their width
to 4. The statement ``Columns("B:P").Select`` is a property of the worksheet, so
prefix it with the ``ws.identifier`` and add the parenthesis to make it a Python
function call. In the next statement, ``Selection`` is a property of excel, so prefix
it as such. The translated statements are shown below.

![idlecolumnwidth](images/20091012_idlecolumnwidth.png)

The Excel spreadsheet is now complete, the multiplication table has been
expanded to 15×15 and the columns have been resized to 4. At this point,
translation of the macro is complete, but the modified file has to be saved. To
write the file and quit Excel, use the SaveAs and Quit methods as shown below.

![idlesavequit](images/20091012_idlesavequit.png)

For your reference, here is the complete Python script.

```
#
# make15x15.py
# Expand an existing 10x10 multiplication table and resize columns
#
import win32com.client as win32
excel = win32.gencache.EnsureDispatch('Excel.Application')
wb = excel.Workbooks.Open('MultiplicationTable.xlsx')
excel.Visible = True
ws = wb.Worksheets('Sheet1')
ws.Range("B11:K11").Select()
excel.Selection.AutoFill(ws.Range("B11:K16"),win32.constants.xlFillDefault)
ws.Range("K2:K16").Select()
excel.Selection.AutoFill(ws.Range("K2:P16"),win32.constants.xlFillDefault)
ws.Columns("B:P").Select()
excel.Selection.ColumnWidth = 4
wb.SaveAs('NewMultiplicationTable.xlsx')
excel.Application.Quit()
```

If this is the first time you’ve ported an Excel macro from VB to Python,
congratulations! Please note that in this example, things are kept simple and
there is absolutely no error checking or exception handling used here. Normally
you would need to provide at least a minimal level of error checking and
exception handling in your script so that common errors (missing input file,
can’t invoke Excel, etc) are caught and handled nicely. Also, this example was
developed using Excel 2007, but you can run this code verbatim on earlier
versions of Excel if you change the .xlsx file extension to .xls throughout the
script.

## Some Porting Guidelines

* Prefix the Range().Select statements with the variable name pointing to the worksheet (ws in this example)
* Append () to any functions
* Prefix the Selection statements with the variable name for the Excel spreadsheet (excel in this example)
* Prefix the Columns statements with the variable name for the worksheet(ws in this example)

Note that I didn’t capture the Workbooks.Open() or Workbooks.SaveAs lines in the VB script, it’s left as an exercise for the reader to research those commands.
