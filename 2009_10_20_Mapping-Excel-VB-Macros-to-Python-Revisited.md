# Mapping Excel VB Macros to Python Revisited


The last post introduced a technique for recording a Visual Basic macro within
Excel and migrating it to Python. This exercise will build on those techniques
while leveraging Python for more of the work.

This example creates two tables from scratch – a simple multiplication table and
a table of random numbers – and applies conditional formatting to the numbers
using some of the new features in Excel 2007 (unfortunately this exercise won’t
be compatible with older versions of Excel). Begin by starting the Python IDLE
interface. Next, start Excel as you’ve done in the previous exercises. For this
exercise, add a workbook using the Workbooks.Add() construct, and set the ws
variable to point to the first worksheet in the workbook.

After typing these command in IDLE, you’ll see the Excel window that contains an
empty spreadsheet. To build the multiplication table, use Python to populate the
column and row headers. There are a number of ways to do this, for this exercise
you’ll pass an list of column header and row header values to Excel. A row of
data is defined by using the ``ws.Range().Valuestatement`` with a list or tuple
on right hand side of the equals sign. Rather than explicitly defining the list
as [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], you can use Python's list comprehension
with a range() statement to populate the values: ``[i for i in range(1,11)]``.
The complete statement is ``ws.Range("B2:K2").Value = [i for i in range(1,11)]``.
Defining a single column of data is a bit trickier, you must define a list of
single element lists or tuples. One way to do this is to use Python’s ``zip()``
function to transpose the flat list into a list of tuples. The complete
statement is ``ws.Range("B2:B11").Value = zip([i for i in range(1,11)])``. The
statements for completing the column and row headers are shown below.

At this point the column and row headers will appear in the Excel spreadsheet.

To define the product values for each cell in the table, create a formula to
multiply the column and row header for a single cell, then used Excel to
autofill the remaining cells. Looking at the spreadsheet, the product for cell
C3 is cell B3 multiplied by cell C2, or 2 times 2 which equals 4. In terms of
Excel, the formula is ``=B3*C2``. To use Excel’s autofill capability, you need to
anchor the row and column in the formula by preceding it with the $ character.
In other words, the formula you want to use is ``=$B3*C$2``. Once that formula is
entered, the expansion to fill the remaining cells is done in two steps. First,
programmatically select the cell and drag it fill the row. Next, select the
newly autofilled row and drag the new row down to fill in the remaining rows.
Since this was demonstrated in the last post, please refer to that post if you
need more information. The equivalent Python code to implement the autofill is
shown below.

The spreadsheet will now contain the complete multiplication table.

To help illustrate conditional formatting, create another table of random
integers between 1 and 100. Excel’s ``RAND()`` function will generate a random
number between 0 and 1, the formula we want is ``=INT(RAND()*100)``. The
``ws.Range().Formula`` construct can be used to fill a range with the same identical
formula.

The Excel spreadsheet should now contain both the multiplication and random
number tables.

Now that the data is ready, conditional formatting can be applied. Even though
you invoked Excel from Python, you still can manipulate the spreadsheet using
the Excel interface, and even record macros. You need to record a macro like you
did in the last post in order to capture the VB commands, so click on Record
Macro in the Developer tab, then click OK in the popup dialog.

Select all the cells in the range B2:K22. In the Home tab, select Conditional
Formatting->Color Scales->Red-Yellow-Blue Color Scale.

The spreadsheet should now show a color background for each of the selected
cells containing a value. Now select cell A1, then stop the macro by clicking
Stop Recording in the Developer tab.

Your spreadsheet will now have conditional formatting applied and will look
something like this, with cells containing numbers near 100 colored in Red,
cells with a value of 50 in Yellow, and cells with a value of 1 in Blue, with a
shade of these colors for values in between:

As an aside, you can update the random numbers in the lower table by hitting the
F9 key to force a spreadsheet recalculation.

To continue, open the macro just created by selecting Macros from the Developer
tab, select the name of the macro you just captured and click Edit. The macro
should look something like this:

```
Sub Macro1()
'
' Macro1 Macro
'
    Range("B2:K22").Select
    Selection.FormatConditions.AddColorScale ColorScaleType:=3
    Selection.FormatConditions(Selection.FormatConditions.Count).SetFirstPriority
    Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(1).Type = _
        xlConditionValueLowestValue
    With Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(1).FormatColor
        .Color = 13011546
        .TintAndShade = 0
    End With
    Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(2).Type = _
        xlConditionValuePercentile
    Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(2).Value = 50
    With Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(2).FormatColor
        .Color = 8711167
        .TintAndShade = 0
    End With
    Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(3).Type = _
        xlConditionValueHighestValue
    With Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(3).FormatColor
        .Color = 7039480
        .TintAndShade = 0
    End With
    Range("A1").Select
End Sub
```

Though the macro contains some very long method names and some ``With``
statements, the porting will be very straightforward. Here are some guidelines
to keep in mind while migrating this code to Python.

* Selection is preceded by ``excel``

Remember that ``Selection`` is a method at the Excel Application level, you need to
precede it with ``excel``. in this example.

* Range is preceded by ``ws``

``Range`` is a method at the Worksheet level, which is defined earlier as ws. in
this example.

* Function calls require ``()`` in Python

Unlike VB, any function calls must by followed by ``()`` in Python.

* ``With`` statements must be expanded

The three ``With`` blocks in this macro need to be expanded, which can be done
with temporary variables or by copying the statement following the ``With`` keyword.
For example, the first ``With`` block:

```
With Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(1).FormatColor
    .Color = 13011546
    .TintAndShade = 0
End With
```

can be written in Python as

```
excel.Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(1).FormatColor.Color = 13011546
excel.Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(1).FormatColor.TintAndShade = 0
```

or by using a temporary variable as

```
x = excel.Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(1).FormatColor
x.Color = 13011546
x.FormatColor.TintAndShade = 0
```

Temporary variables were created to make the script more concise. In particular,
the statement ``[csc1,csc2,csc3] =
[excel.Selection.FormatConditions(1).ColorScaleCriteria(n) for n in range(1,4)]``
was used to create three temporary variables for the three ColorScaleCriteria
methods.

To save the spreadsheet and close Excel, use the ``SaveAs`` and ``Quit`` methods as
shown below.

Here is the complete conditionalformatting.py script. The line ``excel.Visible =
True`` has been commented out. Unless you are developing the script, you typically
want Excel to run invisibly in the background. [https://github.com/pythonexcels/examples/blob/master/conditionalformatting.py](https://github.com/pythonexcels/examples/blob/master/conditionalformatting.py)

ws.Range("B13:K22").Formula = "=INT(RAND()*100)"

csc1.Type = win32.constants.xlConditionValueLowestValue
