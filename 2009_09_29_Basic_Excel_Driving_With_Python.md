# Basic Excel Driving with Python

Now it’s getting interesting. Reading and writing spreadsheets with XLRD and
XLWT (as discussed
[here](2009_09_10_Using_XLWT_to_Write_Spreadsheets_Without_Excel.html) and
[here](2009_09_19_Another_XLWT_Example.html)) is sufficient for many tasks, and
you don’t even need a copy of Excel to do it. But to really open up your data
and fully wring all the information possible from it, you’ll need Excel and its
powerful set of functions, pivot tables and charting.

For starters, let’s do some simple operations using Python to invoke Excel, add
a spreadsheet, insert some data, then save the results to a spreadsheet file.
You can play along at home by following my lead and entering the program text
exactly as I’ve described below. My exercises and screen shots are done with
Excel 2007, but all the commands presented here also work fine for Excel 2003. A
prerequisite for this exercise is Python, the Win32 module and a copy of
Microsoft Excel.

Here is the complete script we’ll be entering using IDLE, the Python interactive
development tool.

```
#
# driving.py
#
import win32com.client as win32
excel = win32.gencache.EnsureDispatch('Excel.Application')
excel.Visible = True
wb = excel.Workbooks.Add()
ws = wb.Worksheets('Sheet1')
ws.Name = 'Built with Python'
ws.Cells(1,1).Value = 'Hello Excel'
print ws.Cells(1,1).Value
for i in range(1,5):
    ws.Cells(2,i).Value = i  # Don't do this
ws.Range(ws.Cells(3,1),ws.Cells(3,4)).Value = [5,6,7,8]
ws.Range("A4:D4").Value = [i for i in range(9,13)]
ws.Cells(5,4).Formula = '=SUM(A2:D4)'
ws.Cells(5,4).Font.Size = 16
ws.Cells(5,4).Font.Bold = True
```

What follows is a step-by-step guide to entering this script and monitoring the result.

### 1. Open the Python IDLE interface from the Start menu

![IDLE Startup](images/20090929_idlestartmenu.png)

IDLE is the Python IDE built with the tkinter GUI toolkit, as quoted from the
Python IDLE documentation, and gives you an interactive interface to enter, run
and save Python programs. IDLE isn’t strictly necessary for this exercise, you
could use any shell command window, or a tool such as IPython or the MS Windows
command line interface.

### 2. Import the win32 module

![importwin32](images/20090929_idleimport.png)

If the import command was successful, you’ll see the “>>>” prompt returned. If
there was a problem, such as not having the win32 module installed correctly,
you’ll see ``Import Error: Nomodule named win32com.client``. In that case, install
the appropriate win32 module from the web site.

### 3. Start Excel

The command ``win32.gencache.EnsureDispatch('Excel.Application')`` attaches to an
Excel process that is already running, or starts Excel if it’s not. If you see
the “>>>” prompt, Excel has been started or linked successfully. At this point
you won’t see Excel, but if you check your task manager you can confirm that the
process is running.

### 4. Make Excel Visible

Setting the Visible flag with ``excel.Visible = True`` makes the Excel window
appear. At this point, Excel does not contain any workbooks or worksheets, we’ll
add those in the next step.

### 5. Add a workbook, select the sheet “Sheet1” and rename it

![idlewbws](images/20090929_idlewbws.png)

Excel needs a workbook to serve as a container for the worksheets. A new
workbook containing 3 sheets is added with command ``wb = excel.Workbooks.Add()``.
The command ``ws=wb.Worksheets('Sheet1')`` assigns ws to the sheet named Sheet1,
and the command ``ws.Name ='Built with Python'`` changes the name of Sheet1 to
“Built with Python”. Your screen should now look something like this:

![excelblank](images/20090929_excelblank.png)

### 6. Add some text into the first cell

![idlehello](images/20090929_idlehello.png)

Now the setup is complete and you can add data to the spreadsheet. There are
several options for addressing cells and blocks of data in Excel, I’ll cover a
few of them here. You can address individual cells with the
``Cells(row,column).Value`` pattern, where row and column are integer values
representing the row and column location for the cell. Note that row and column
counts begin from one, not zero. Use ``.Value`` to add text, numbers and date
information to the cell and use ``.Formula`` for entering an Excel formula into the
cell location.

After typing these commands, you’ll see the “Hello Excel” text in your Excel
worksheet, and see the text printed in the IDLE window as well. Of course,
Python can set values in the spreadsheet as well as query data from the
spreadsheet.

### 7. Populate the second row with data by using a for loop

![idle_for_loop](images/20090929_idlefor.png)

In many cases you’ll have lists of data to insert into or extract from the
worksheet. Wrapping the Cells(row,column).Value pattern with a loop seems like a
natural approach, but in reality this maximizes the communication overhead
between Python and Excel and results in very inefficient and slow code. It’s
much better to transfer lists than individual elements whenever possible as
shown in the next section. After this command, your Excel spreadsheet will look
like this:

![For loop results in excel](images/20090929_excelfor.png)

### 8. Populate the third and fourth rows of data

![Range insertion](images/20090929_idlerange.png)

A better approach to populating or extracting blocks of data is to use the
``Range().Value`` pattern. With this construct you can efficiently transfer a one-
or two-dimensional blocks of data. In the first example, cells (3,1) through
(3,4) are assigned to the list [5,6,7,8]. The next line uses the Excel-style
cell address “A4:D4” to assign the results of the operation ``[i for i in range(9,13)]``.
In some cases, it may be more intuitive to use the Excel-style
naming. The Excel sheet now looks like this:

![Excel data insertion](images/20090929_excelfourrows.png)

### 9. Assign a formula to sum the numbers just added

![Formula insertion](images/20090929_idleformula.png)

You can insert Excel formulas into cells using the .Formula pattern. The formula
is the same as if you were to enter it in Excel: ``=SUM(A2:D4)``. In this example,
the sum of 12 numbers in rows 2,3 and 4 is generated. Your Excel sheet should
now look like the screenshot below.

![Excel Formula](images/20090929_excelformula.png)

### 11. Change the formatting of the formula cell

![Formatting data](images/20090929_idleformat.png)

As a final exercise, the format of the formula cell is changed to point size 16
with a bold typeface. You can change any of dozens of attributes for the various
cells in the worksheet through Python. Your spreadsheet should now look like
this.

Hopefully you did this exercise interactively, typing the commands and
monitoring the result in Excel. You can also cut to the chase and run this
script to generate the result. When the script exits, you’ll be left with an
open Excel spreadsheet just as shown in the last screenshot above.
