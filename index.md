It’s time to give back. And get back.

## [Using XLWT to Write Spreadsheets Without Excel](./2009_09_10_Using_XLWT_to_Write_Spreadsheets_Without_Excel.html)

Long before I even started thinking about writing a blog covering the
integration possibilities between Excel and Python, the folks at

of the handiest Python modules around: xlrd, xlwt and xlutils.

## [Another XLWT Example](./2009_09_19_Another_XLWT_Example.html)

After completing the [last
example](./2009_09_10_Using_XLWT_to_Write_Spreadsheets_Without_Excel.html), I

you don’t even need a copy of Excel to do it. But to really open up your data
and fully wring all the information possible from it, you’ll need Excel and its
powerful set of functions, pivot tables and charting.
